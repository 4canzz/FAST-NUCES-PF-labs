/*Exercise 1: (15 points)
Create two classes DM and DB that store the value of distances. DM stores distance in meters and centimeters and DB converts them
to feet and inches.

Write a program that can read values for the class objects and converts them. Use a friend function to carry out the conversion
operation by getting values from the user. The object that stores the results should be a DB object, depending on the units in which
the results are required. The display should be in the format of feet and inches.*/
