Problem Statement: 
Construct a C++ software system for a vehicle rental company to manage a fleet of vehicles(mainly cars and trucks), customer records, 
and rental transactions. Each vehicle shouldhavedetails such as model, manufacturing year, rental price per day, and availability 
status. If a truckisrented price will include 5% commercial tax. Customer records should store their name, cnic and mobile number. 
It should be possible to search for a customer’s rental history. Rental transactions should track the associated customer and vehicle, 
rental start and end dates, and rental cost calculation based on price and duration. The system must track whether vehicles are 
currentlyrented or available and update their status accordingly. Customers should be able to searchforvehicles by model, filter them 
by rental price range, and check availability. The systemmust alsostore and manage dynamic lists of vehicles, customers, and rental 
transactions. 

Objectives: 
∙ Design one class which when instantiated should be able to carry customer, vehicle or transactions data. 
e.g. List<Vehicle*> *vehicles = new List <Vehicle*>(100); // able to carry upto 100 vehicles 
List<Customer*> *clients = new List <Customer*>(50); // able to carry upto 50 customes
∙ Customers should be able to search for and book available vehicles. 
∙ Vehicle rental company should be able to search for rental history of a customer fromtransactions data. 
∙ Vehicle rental company should be able to charge the customer the correct amount based on for how long the vehicle was rented, rent
per day and if it was a truck then an additional 5% tax needs to be paid.
