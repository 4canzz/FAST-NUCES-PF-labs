CLO No. 2: Design a program using object-oriented programming paradigm. 
How can you design a memory-efficient Sparse Matrix Calculator using Object-Oriented Programming(OOP)principles in C++. 
You are required to create a class of sparse matrix. The data members of the class must be numberofrows,number of columns and a
oointer to pointer to store the elements of the matrix. This class-baseddesigncanuse pointers, dynamic memory allocation, and
efficient data storage techniques. Your programshouldsupportmatrixoperations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
transpose. Implement all the operationsonsparsematrix as member functions of the sparse matrix class. 

Sparse Matrix: 
A sparse matrix is a matrix in which most of the elements are zero. Storing all elements (including zeros) in memory is not efficient.
To overcome this, we store only non-zero elements along with their positions. 

Operations: 
Output matrix: Output a sparse matrix in standard form (both zero and non-zero entries) 
Addition: Implement a function to add two sparse matrices if they are compatible for addition andreturn the resultant. 
Subtraction: Implement a function to subtract one sparse matrix from another if they are compatiblefor subtraction and return the resultant. 
Multiplication: Implement a function to multiply two sparse matrices if they are compatible for multiplicationand return the resultant. 
Transpose: Implement a function to transpose a sparse matrix. 

Assignment Tasks: 
1. Implement the add, subtract, multiply, and transpose functions using the given explanation. 
2. Ensure memory efficiency by storing only non-zero elements and their positions. 
3. Write a main function to demonstrate matrix addition, subtraction, multiplication, and transposewithappropriate examples. 
4. Include comments to explain your code. 
Good luck, and happy coding!!
