/*Exercise 2: (10 points)
Define a class called bankAccount to store a bank customerâ€™s account number and balance.
Suppose that account number is of type int, and balance is of type double. Your class should, at
least, provide the following operations: set the account number, retrieve the account number,
retrieve the balance, deposit and withdraw money, and print account information. Add
appropriate constructors.

Every bank offers a savings account. Derive the class savingsAccount from the class
bankAccount. This class inherits members to store the account number and the balance from the
base class. A customer with a savings account typically receives interest, makes deposits, and
withdraws money. In addition to the operations inherited from the base class, this class should
provide the following operations: set interest rate, retrieve interest rate, post interest and print
account information. Add appropriate constructors.

Write a program to test your classes designed. */
