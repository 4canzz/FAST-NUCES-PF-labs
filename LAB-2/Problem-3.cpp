/*Exercise 3: (10 points)

Write a code that merges two arrays. Create two dynamic arrays of sizes size_1 and size_2
respectively. Take input in these arrays from the user. Now create a third array of size
(size_1+size_2) and insert all the elements of both arrays in this array. Remove the duplicate
elements from this array and resize the array to a smaller size.
Example:

Array 1 -> 1 2 3 4
Array 2 -> 3 4 5 6 7

After merging Array1 and Array2:

Array 3 -> 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 6 7

After removing duplicate elements, this array should be of size 6:

Array 3 -> 1 2 3 4 5 6 7*/
