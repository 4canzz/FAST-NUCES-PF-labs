/*Question No. 5 (CLO No. 1) Marks: 6

Write a program that allows the user to enter the last names of five candidates in a local election and the
number of votes received by each candidate. The program should then output each candidateâ€™s name, the
number of votes received, and the percentage of the total votes received by the candidate. Your program
should also output the winner of the election. A sample output is:
Candidate   Votes Received      % of Total Votes
Johnson         5000              25.91
Miller          4000              20.73
Duffy           6000              31.09
Robinson        2500              12.95
Ashtony         1800              9.33
Total           19300

The Winner of the Election is Duffy. */
